## News API Website


Simple website built with create-react-app to test out using the News API. Quick project meant to practice fetching API data in React and creating a layout of the top breaking news from multiple sources in a grid-like setting. 

Update 3/2021 - News API has changed their pricing format for API utilization and will have to implement a Node(Express) server.
